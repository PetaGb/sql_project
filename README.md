## Project Goal

The objective of this project is to address five research questions related to the accessibility of basic foods, primarily focusing on the trends in prices and wages.

1. Have wages increased across all industries over the years, or have some witnessed a decline?
2. What is the purchasing power for liters of milk and kilograms of bread during the first and last comparable periods based on available data on prices and wages?
3. Which food category exhibits the slowest price increase (lowest percentage year-on-year growth)?
4. Is there a specific year where the year-on-year increase in food prices significantly exceeded wage growth (greater than 10%)?
5. Does the GDP level impact changes in wages and food prices? In other words, if GDP experiences a notable increase in a given year, does it manifest in a more pronounced rise in food prices or wages in the same or subsequent year?

### Data Analysis

The responses to these questions will be derived from two tables created specifically for this purpose using data from available sources. The first table will address questions 1-4, while the second table will provide insights into question #5.
